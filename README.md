# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

Odin Recipes is a simple web project created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. This project aims to practice and demonstrate basic HTML skills by creating a recipe website.

## Project Structure

The website consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. This project is primarily focused on building HTML skills, so the design will be minimal at first.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Basic HTML structure
- Creating lists (ordered and unordered)
- Linking between pages
- Adding images to web pages
- Writing commit messages
- Publishing to GitHub

## Future Improvements

As you progress through The Odin Project curriculum, you may revisit this project to add:

- CSS styling to improve the visual design
- JavaScript functionality for interactivity
- More recipes and categories
- A search function
